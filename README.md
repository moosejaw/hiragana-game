# Hiragana Game
## Introduction
A very simple terminal-based Python game for testing your hiragana knowledge. It is currently unfinished.

This project was written in Python 3.7.3.

### Important Note
```hiragana.csv``` contains the mapping of each hiragana letter to its given pronunciation, but it does not yet contain the complete alphabet. You can populate it further manually if you want to.

## Principle
The ```game.py``` script loads the ```hiragana.csv``` file and populates a ```dict``` object with the letters and their sounds, as specified in the CSV file.

When you play the game, a random hiragana letter from the dictionary will be chosen and presented to you, to which you must answer with the corresponding pronounciation.

For example, „Åã is pronounced 'ka', so you would answer with 'ka'.

The game will tell you whether you're correct or incorrect.

## Playing the game in a virtual environment
As with most Python apps, you can also use the game with ```virtualenv```.

Just initialise the virtual environment somewhere and activate it.

Then, in the context of the project folder you can run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
as normal to install the dependencies.

## Future improvements
I'm writing the code for this as I explore my learning of the Japanese language further. Therefore, I'll probably add katakana once I start trying to learn it.
