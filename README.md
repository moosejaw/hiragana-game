# Hiragana Game
A very simple Python-based game for testing your hiragana knowledge.

## Principle
The ```game.py``` script loads the ```hiragana.csv``` file and populates a ```dict``` object with the letters and their sounds, as specified in the CSV file.

When you play the game, a random hiragana letter from the dictionary will be chosen and presented to you, to which you must answer with the corresponding pronounciation.

For example, „Åã is pronounced 'ka', so you would answer with 'ka'.

The game will tell you whether you're correct or incorrect.

## Playing the game in a virtual environment
As with most Python apps, you can also use the game with ```virtualenv```.

Just initialise the virtual environment inside the root folder:
```bash
$ virtualenv .
```

Then, activate the environment:
```bash
$ source ./bin/activate
```

Then you can ```pip install requirements.txt``` as normal to install the dependencies.
